#Â Since we use bash to ping the db, there are a few symbols that we can't use
# - "!", will get a "bash: !X: event not found" error
# - "*", globbing will be performed, resulting unreachable db "mysql://db:<pass-with-*>@db:<pass-with-*>@db/db"
# - "@", will result in unreachable db "mysql://db:<pass-with-@>@db:3306/db"
